#### About
Here are some scripts that I use with Greasemonkey and have been abandoned/not updated by its authors or broken by updates made on the pages for which they were created. I've fixed them the best I can with my limited knowledge.

#### DuckDuckGo Links To Other Engines. **[Install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Odyseus/GreasemonkeyScripts/master/DuckDuckGoLinksToOtherEngines/ddgltoe.user.js)**
This script adds to **DuckDuckGo** results page some links to other search engines.

#### Google Translator Tooltip Expanded Fork. **[Install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Odyseus/GreasemonkeyScripts/master/GoogleTranslatorTooltipExpandedFork/gttef.user.js)**
This script displays a tooltip with expanded translation provided by **Google Translate**. The original author is **[Mar Cnu](http://userscripts-mirror.org/users/marcnu.html
)** and the original version of this script can be found **[here](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/150664.html)**.
After Greasemonkey was updated to version 2.x, the script stopped working. So I fixed it.
The only thing I modified to the script is that I have specified all **@grant** values inside the metadata block of this script. I have also updated the ColorPicker library to a new version.

#### Unique Youtube Skin Fork. **[Install script](https://github.com/Odyseus/GreasemonkeyScripts/raw/master/UniqueYoutubeSkinFork/uys.user.js)**
This is a script for YouTube to be used with Greasemonkey. The original author is **[Haluk Ilhan](https://github.com/halukilhan)** and the original version of this script can be found **[here](https://github.com/halukilhan/uys)**.
After Greasemonkey was updated to version 2.x and/or some updates from **YouTube**, some functions of this script stopped working. So I fixed it.

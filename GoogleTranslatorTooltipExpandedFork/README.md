#### About
This script displays a tooltip with expanded translation provided by **Google Translate**. The original author is **[Mar Cnu](http://userscripts-mirror.org/users/marcnu.html
)** and the original version of this script can be found **[here](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/150664.html)**.
After Greasemonkey was updated to version 2.x, the script stopped working. So I fixed it.
The only thing I modified to the script is that I have specified all **@grant** values inside the metadata block of this script. I have also updated the ColorPicker library to a new version.

#### Usage
* Install **[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)** extension and restart your browser.
* Install **[Google Translator Tooltip Expanded Fork script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Odyseus/GreasemonkeyScripts/master/GoogleTranslatorTooltipExpandedFork/gttef.user.js)**.
* Select a text, move the mouse over the 'translate' icon, and a tooltip with the translation appears. See image below.

#### Note
* Although I have some knowledge of JavaScript, I am NOT a developer of any kind. I managed to fix this script by applying some common sense and frankly it's a miracle that I was able to make it work. Knowing this, do not expect from me a prompt response when this script is broken do to the next **Google Translate** update.

#### Note
* Although I have some knowledge of JavaScript, I am NOT a developer of any kind. I managed to fix this script by applying some common sense and frankly it's a miracle that I was able to make it work. Knowing this, do not expect from me a prompt response when this script is broken do to the next **YouTube** update.
